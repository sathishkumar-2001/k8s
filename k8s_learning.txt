KUBERNETES 

DAY 1 :

k8s -> container orchestration platform

problems in docker :
     single host platform that means we deploy container on top of sinlge vm
	 not auto healing
	 not auto scaling
	 no Enterprise level support
	 
how k8s solves the above issues
     cluster - group of nodes
	 replica set  , hpa
	 k8s autoheals 
	 
	 
kubernets -> k8s -> k to s 8 letters

kubernets architecture

Pod - A Kubernetes pod is a collection of one or more containers, and is the smallest unit of a Kubernetes application

# Control plane (master node) 
## api server - core component of k8s, accepts all incoming  reqs, exposes k8s to external world.
## etcd - key value store, cluster related infos.
## scheduler - scheduling pods or resources on k8s, receives info from api server & acts on it
## controller manager - ensures controllers like replica set are running
## cloud controller manager - like terraform

# Data plane (worker node)
## kubelet - creates pod, ensures pod is always running
## kube proxy - provides networking like Docker0, default load balancing
## container runtime - runs container inside pod

container runtime k8s can use -> docker shim , crio , containerd

most familiar used k8s distributions -> kubernets , openshift , Rancher , tanzu , EKS , AKS , GKE

Kops - is the tool use to configure/install the kubernetes by our own
