1. Rolling Update
How it works: Updates pods incrementally, one or a few at a time, until all the old pods are replaced by new ones.
Pros:
Minimal downtime since the application remains available during the update.
Simple and automated by Kubernetes (default deployment strategy).
Cons:
If an issue arises, rollback might result in partial downtime.
Limited control over which users get the updated version.
Best for:
Stable applications with predictable behavior.
Implementation in K8s: Default behavior in kubectl apply or a Deployment resource.
2. Canary Deployment
How it works: Gradually routes a small percentage of traffic to the new version while monitoring performance. If stable, traffic to the new version is increased.
Pros:
Controlled risk: only a small percentage of users see the new version initially.
Easier rollback since most traffic remains with the old version.
Cons:
Requires traffic-splitting capabilities (e.g., Istio, Linkerd, or custom ingress rules).
Monitoring and automation are critical for success.
Best for:
Testing features in production environments.
Implementation in K8s: Use service mesh tools (e.g., Istio) or traffic-shifting mechanisms with ingress controllers.
3. Blue-Green Deployment
How it works: Maintains two environments (Blue: current version, Green: new version). Traffic is switched to the Green environment once it's verified to be working.
Pros:
Zero downtime.
Easy rollback (just switch back to Blue).
Cons:
High resource cost (two full environments running simultaneously).
Requires careful synchronization of databases and shared resources.
Best for:
Critical systems that cannot tolerate any downtime.
Implementation in K8s: Use separate namespaces or deployments for Blue and Green environments, with a load balancer to switch traffic.
4. Recreate Deployment
How it works: Deletes all existing pods before creating new ones.
Pros:
Simple to implement.
Useful when old and new versions cannot run simultaneously.
Cons:
Downtime during deployment.
Best for:
Non-critical applications or incompatible updates.
Implementation in K8s: Set strategy: type: Recreate in the deployment spec.
5. A/B Testing
How it works: Similar to Canary, but focuses on comparing the performance or user behavior between versions.
Pros:
Excellent for feature validation and user behavior testing.
Cons:
Requires advanced monitoring and traffic routing.
Best for:
Feature experimentation and user engagement analysis.
Implementation in K8s: Requires integration with analytics tools and traffic management (e.g., Istio).
6. Shadow Deployment
How it works: The new version receives a copy of live traffic for testing, but responses are not sent to users.
Pros:
Zero risk since live traffic isn't affected.
Ideal for testing performance or load scenarios.
Cons:
Requires duplication of resources for the new version.
Monitoring and logging systems must handle duplicate traffic.
Best for:
Validating behavior under live traffic without user impact.
Implementation in K8s: Use a service mesh or ingress controllers to duplicate traffic to the shadow deployment.
7. Progressive Delivery (Feature Flags)
How it works: Feature toggles control which users see new functionality. Code for both versions exists, but toggles enable gradual rollout.
Pros:
Extremely granular control over feature exposure.
Quick rollback by disabling the feature flag.
Cons:
Increased complexity in application code.
Requires feature management tooling (e.g., LaunchDarkly, Flagsmith).
Best for:
Testing new features at user-level granularity.
Implementation in K8s: Not directly Kubernetes-specific, but works well with Canary or Blue-Green setups.
